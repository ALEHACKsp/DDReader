DDReader is a DAISY books reader (DAISY 3.0) created by Pedro Milliet, Eduardo Perez and the Dorina Foundation for the Blind (from Brazil)
It is now an addon for Firefox, but is expected to evolve into a standalone application. 
It is available in three languages (Portuguese, Spanish and English). DDReader has a lot of features to easy the users reading experience.
We are planning to make it available for Linux, Mac and Android platforms. The full documentation will be uploaded as soon as possible.
If you want to join us, please send me a message (pedro.milliet@gmail.com).
The code is mostly javascript, Xul and HTML. There is also a Dll in C to deal with the TTS bridge between Firefox and Windows SAPI5.
